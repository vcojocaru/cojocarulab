The project is aimed at understanding the mechanisms by which a special class of proteins essential for gene regulation (transcription factors) bind to DNA when wrapped around histone proteins as it is in the genome in our cells. Transcription factors are fascinating molecules that define the identity of cells and are capable of promoting healthy or pathological cellular transitions.
